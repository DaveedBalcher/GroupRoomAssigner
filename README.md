# TaglitRoomAssigner

###Problem 
In a given year, Birthright sends about 1,100 groups of 40 participants on heritage trips to Israel. It is time consuming to create different room assignments for participants each night while taking into account factors such as pairing history, age, gender. Birthright requires participants to be grouped with different roommates each night throughout the trip to enhance cohesiveness of a group. 

###Solution
Instantly accounting for several factors (pairing history, age, gender) and generating different room assignments each night for large groups.  

###Technology
* Language: **Swift 2.1**
* Storing participant information using **CoreData**
* Utilizing a **Compatibility Rating System** to decide which participant would make the best roommates
* Displaying information and room pairings in **UITableViews** with custom **UITableViewCell subclasses**
